Minutes:

David finished up the pathfinding algorithm with collision detection and has begun commenting and cleanup on his pathfinding classes. Creatures are not properly moving around the map, though they still get stuck occasionally. Keith finished up the menu system and has also begun cleanup and commenting of the map generation code, the game, the menus, and the hud. Both Steven and Ben, having completed their tasks for the project, have been going through the Creatures and Things refactoring method order and commenting the code. Everyone has done a great job.
