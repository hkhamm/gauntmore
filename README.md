# Gauntmore

Gauntmore is a 2D, top down, hack-and-slash, real-time, roguelike, with procedural tile-based map generation, and permanent death.

The project is being built at the University of Oregon for CIS 330 in Winter 2015 by Keith Hamm, David Wenzel, Benjamin Barnes, and Steven Warren.

## Compile and run the project

This project uses CMake. To make compiling and running the project easier, from the main gauntmore folder issue this command: `./run.sh`.

## Gameplay and Controls

In the game you navigate a procedurally generated maze while fighting monstrous creatures, collecting gold, and trying to survive. If you can make it to the exit without dying, congratulations! Throughout the game you will be attacked by creatures that reduce your health. To recover health you can run over potions dropped by creates or found in chests. Also found in chests are weapon and armor upgrades. These increase your attack damage or reduce the amount of damage you receive.

Warning: this game is hard. If you simply cannot solve the maze, you can always cheat by looking at the map printed to the console.
